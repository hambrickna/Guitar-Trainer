# Guitar Trainer 
A web application that facilitates guitar theory learning through interactive exercises.  The application incorporates the YIN pitch detection algorithm allowing users to complete exercises using their guitar, bridging the gap from mouse and keyboard interactions to practical guitar theory practice.

## Finished Objectives
